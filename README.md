## Welcome

Reusable workflows offer a simple and powerful way to avoid copying and pasting workflows across your repositories, and adding a matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps engineers, students, managers, teams, GitHub users.
- **What you'll learn**: How to create and use reusable workflows, create a matrix strategy, trigger workflows, and find workflow logs.
- **What you'll build**: An Actions workflow with a matrix strategy that calls a reusable workflow to output multiple verisions of node.
- **Prerequisites**: In this course you will work with pull requests and YAML workflow files. We recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github) course first or be familiar with GitHub basics, and the [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions) course for an introduction to GitHub Actions and workflow files.
- **How long**: This course can be finished in less than one hour.
- **Attribution**: This Skills course was inspired by a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBpyouQtY_M) created by Mickey Gousset ([@mickeygousset](https://github.com/mickeygousset)).

In this course, you will:

1. Make a reusable workflow
2. Add a job
3. Add a matrix strategy
4. Merge your pull request
5. Trigger the workflow

### How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
